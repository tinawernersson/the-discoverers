## This is The Discoverers Preschool

The Discoverers Preschool want to educate small children into good and independent citizens by taking care of their own interests and abilities. The preschool teachers can then make the education more idividual-based so every child can participate on their own terms. The name "Discoverers" is a way of think of children as discoverers. Adults can learn very much about the children and of a specific subject if they work together and discover things together! All children are welcome to The Discoverers Preschool.
