## This is The Discoverers Preschool

The Discoverers Preschool want to educate small children into good and independent citizens by taking care of their own interests and abilities. The preschool teachers can then make the education more idividual-based so every child can participate on their own terms. The name "Discoverers" is a way of think of children as discoverers. Adults can learn very much about the children and of a specific subject if they work together and discover things together! All children are welcome to The Discoverers Preschool.

   ## Typography

For The Discoverers Preschool I used Google Fonts as it is easy to use, accessible and make the design of the page more appealing.

Here are the links to the fonts and icons I've used in my project:

- [Patrick Hand SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC) was used for all primary texts such as header, headings and in the sign up form.

- [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used on the home page and sign up form, such as the social media icons in the footer (on all pages).
